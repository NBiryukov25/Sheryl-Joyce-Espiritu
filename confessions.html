      <p>To the Woman I Once Called Mine,</p>
      <p>Joyce,</p>
      <p>This letter isnâ€™t about punishment. Itâ€™s about truth, and whatâ€™s owed between souls when love has been mishandled...</p>
      <p>So let me be clear: I release you.</p>
      <p>You no longer owe <em>me</em> anythingâ€”not emotionally, not materially, not physically...</p>
      <p>But Iâ€™m not letting this debt vanish into thin air. What you were given wasnâ€™t charity. It was sacred...</p>
      <p>If you still have any honor left in you, then do something meaningful with what I gave...</p>
      <p>Build something. A space. A life. A relationship...</p>
      <p>I no longer call you mine. But I do call you responsibleâ€”for where my love goes from here.</p>

          <p>I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits, though I know my actions may have caused you much pain and sorrow. I am writing to you today with a heart full of remorse and a soul eager to seek your forgiveness. I have come to realize the depth of my mistakes and the hurt I have caused you. I need to unburden my soul and confess all my misdeeds, hoping that my sincerity and humility will touch your heart and help you find it in you to forgive me.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I want to apologize for not being fully present in our relationship. I kept parts of myself hidden, afraid to expose my vulnerabilities. I told myself I was being strong, but in truth, I was a coward. I was afraid that if I opened up, I'd fall apart. That I'd be too much for you, or not enough. I regret this deeply, my love. You deserved better. You deserved all of me, not just the parts I was comfortable sharing. I promise you, from this day forward, I will strive to be more transparent, to share my fears and insecurities with you, and to meet you with an open heart, no matter how difficult it may be.</p>
          <p>I also want to apologize for the times I sensed your need for me, your softness reaching out, and instead of meeting you there, I stayed quiet, protected in my silence. I told myself I was being strong, but really, I was afraid. Afraid that if I opened up, I'd fall apart. That I'd be too much. Or not enough. I regret it. Not because you asked for more, but because you deserved it. You deserved my honesty, my openness, my love in its entirety. I feel ashamed for letting fear shape the way I loved you. I've always prided myself on being present, but presence without honesty is just a shell. And I can't be that anymoreâ€”not with you.</p>
          <p>I want to apologize for leaving you. I left you not with a storm or a scream, but with silence. One day, I stopped reaching. Stopped showing up. I told myself it was better that wayâ€”that slipping out quietly would hurt you less than a dramatic goodbye. But the truth is, I was a coward. I couldn't bear the weight of your eyes when I told you I was done. I couldn't stand to watch you break, knowing I was the reason. So, I disappeared. And I hate myself for it. I left you with questions, with emptiness, with no shape to your grief. I made you doubt yourself, when it was never you. It was meâ€”too lost, too tangled in my own confusion to be the kind of person you needed, the one I promised to be.</p>
          <p>I understand the seriousness of my actions, Aden. I know that my mistakes have caused you deep pain, and I am committed to making amends in any way possible. I am willing to go all the way for my atonement. I remember our conversation about Charles, your boss's father. You mentioned how he needed someone to sit with him, to provide comfort and care. I am ready to take on that role, to be his caregiver, to dress in the finest, most elegant lingerie as a symbol of my devotion and submission. I will be there for him, day and night, ensuring his every need is met with kindness and patience. If anything Charles asks me to do is disgusting, I will swallow my pride and my tastebuds and fulfill his desires. I will let him use me in any way he wants, to show my complete submission and devotion. I will let him take me in every way imaginable, to prove that I am serious about my atonement. I will let him use my body for his pleasure, to ease his loneliness and discomfort. I will do this not just for him, but for you, to show you that I am willing to go to the extremes to make things right between us.</p>
          <p>During the day, I will tend to his physical needs, making sure he is comfortable and well-cared for. I will prepare his meals, help him with his exercises, and ensure his living space is clean and inviting. But at night, when the house is quiet and the world is asleep, I will be there to comfort him in a more intimate way. I will sit by his side, my hand gently resting on his, whispering soft words of reassurance. I will dress in the delicate lingerie, not to entice, but to honor him and show my commitment. I will massage his tired muscles, easing any discomfort he may feel. I will hold him close, letting him know that he is not alone, that he is loved and cherished. I will be his comfort, his solace, his guardian in the night.</p>
          <p>I want to make this right, Aden. I want to earn your forgiveness, not with empty words, but with actions. I want to restore what I broke, to heal what I wounded, and to love you as I should have from the start. I am ready to submit to your will, to be molded by your hands, to become the woman you need me to be. I want to be your wife, your lover, your confidante, your everything. But more than that, I want to be your humble servant, your devoted disciple, your obedient student. I want to learn from you, to grow with you, to love with you.</p>
          <p>I love you, my dearest. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. My love for you is a constant, a beacon that guides me through the darkest nights. I want to spend the rest of my days making up for the pain I caused, for the love I withheld. I want to be your rock, your sanctuary, your safe haven. I want to be the one you turn to in times of joy and sorrow, the one who makes your heart skip a beat, the one who sets your soul on fire. I want to be your everything, just as you are mine.</p>
          <p>So, I ask you, my love, my life, my all, please find it in your heart to forgive me. Not for my sake, but for yours. So that you may find peace, so that you may heal, so that you may love again. I am here, waiting, hoping, praying that you will give me the chance to make things right. I am willing to do whatever it takes to regain your trust, your respect, and your love. I am ready to prove to you that I am worthy of your forgiveness, that I am capable of being the woman you need me to be.</p>
          <p>With all my love, now and forever,</p>
          <span class="signature">Joyce</span>

          <p>P.S. I enclose a photo of myself, a reminder of the woman you once loved, the woman who is still here, still waiting, still hoping. I am yours, my love, always and forever. Use me, mold me, command me. I am your humble servant, your devoted lover, your eternal student. I am ready to walk this path of redemption with you, to grow, to learn, and to love more deeply than I ever have before.</p>
