      My Love, <br><br>

      I am your Joyce, the woman who once filled your heart with hope, laughter, and affection—and then tore it all down with silence, abandonment, and betrayal. <br><br>

      I am sorry… for disappearing without the grace you deserved. <br><br>

      I regret not ending our relationship with maturity, compassion, and transparency. Instead, I acted with cowardice. I withdrew emotionally, avoided the weight of accountability, and let you fall into confusion and anguish. You called this the mismanagement of the breakup—and you were right. It was reckless, selfish, and unworthy of the love you had given me. <br><br>

      I am sorry for the ring and the petition. <br><br>

      You sacrificed so much, and I treated it as disposable. I said I would return the ring, and yet for a time, I did not. I made you feel used. I see now that even if I hadn’t asked for it, accepting it meant I accepted the bond—and when I walked away, I owed more than silence. I owed you honor. <br><br>

      I am sorry for not facing my pathology. <br><br>

      You asked me: had I found the courage to face the creature within me—the one who deceives, who flees, who inflicts harm without fully grasping the depth? I hadn’t. But I must. I am not just sorry for what I did—I am terrified by what I was capable of becoming. <br><br>

      And if, my love… you move forward and marry someone else—then I will not resist the justice of this world. I will still repay what I owe. Every peso, every token of affection, every word I failed to speak when you needed truth—I will pass it forward. I will designate these reparations to her—your wife, your partner, your peace. Whether she knows me or not, I will carry my guilt and let it be transformed into blessings for her life. For your home. For your joy. <br><br>

      If it pleases you, I will do this publicly or in silence, with your guidance. For the world must see: I hurt a good man, and he still taught me how to love with reverence. <br><br>

      If your path leads you away from me—if your heart finds its peace in the arms of another—then I will not cling to you in bitterness or sorrow. I will honor your choice, and I will carry the imprint of your love inside me like a sacred tattoo over my soul. <br><br>

      And then… I will begin again. <br><br>

      I will pour my tender, Filipina heart into a new offering—a space of warmth, serenity, and refuge. A lovingly crafted bnb escape nestled where kindness can breathe and longing can be met with soft glances and gentle laughter. It will be more than a place—it will be an experience, a sanctuary for kind souls who seek connection and peace. <br><br>

      There, through a graceful web portal, those who are drawn to my spirit will find me—not loud, not demanding, but present. They will be met with warm coffee, homemade meals, a soft smile at the door, and maybe… just maybe, my heart will flutter again when someone dares to flirt with sweetness, not games. <br><br>

      And if one dares to feel me—to truly feel who I am, and how much love I still long to give—I will respond not with caution, but with open soul. I will offer him soft touches, tender words, a gaze that invites him in. And should he love the feeling of being felt—of being wanted not for power, but for peace—I will surrender gently. <br><br>

      For even if I was not your forever, I was born to love. And love… I always will. <br><br>

      <em>I love you always,<br>Joyce</em>
